# Beginner and Intermediate courses February 2019

This is an early announcement of our next R course. Dates are currently penciled in for 5th-8th February, but final dates are yet to be confirmed.

These R workshops are especially tailored for biology/ecology, but will be useful for anyone working in sciences. We often have people from other sciences, like medicine attend.

Location is at the Centre for Applications in Natural Resource Management, The University of Queensland in Brisbane Australia.
Student discounts on course fees are available.

Presenters:  Prof Anthony Richardson (UQ Centre for Applications in Natural Resource Mathematics), Associate Prof David Schoeman (University of the Sunshine Coast),
Dr Chris Brown (Griffith University) and the Advanced R Dr Bill Venables (CSIRO).

We provide comprehensive Workshop notes, including basic theory, applied worked examples in biology/ecology, and solution code.
Here is the course schedule from 2018, 2019 will be similar, but we update it to teach the latest in R each year.
In 2019 we plan to add a whole day for graphics, especially the use of the 'ggplot2' R package for plotting complex datasets.

Testimonials
June 2017: “I truly enjoyed the whole workshop. Great teachers, really nice real data examples and good notes and background. Everything was very well thought out and explained.”
June 2017: “I was really impressed with everything covered and how it was presented. I am feeling a lot better about using stats now than I was previously. I think it should be a compulsory course for all PhDs, particularly in biol/sees/gpem.”
