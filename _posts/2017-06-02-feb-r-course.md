# Beginner and Intermediate courses June 2017

We just ran begginer and intermediate R courses at The University of Queensland. Here is some feedback from attendees.

“I think this is one of the best workshops I have been to in terms of achieving the set goals. I now have the ability to start chasing stats in R."

"The whole course was excellent! Well organised, great notes. The informal style made it easy to ask questions. Will definitely recommend to others."

"As a complete newbie to R, and having just had a panic attack last week about needing to run CART and Random Forest with little know-how, this was a phenomenal workshop. I feel like I have a much better grasp of the program and its coding language, and am much more confident that I'll be able to adeptly run my analyses. ... brought me back from the brink of quitting my PhD!”
