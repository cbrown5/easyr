Webpage under development for Ant, Dave and Chris R resources.

TODO:
- Add some graphics made with R to home page e.g. GAM fits from Copepod data? see plankton.jpg. Need to work on layout for this...

- Who we are - please edit and add something about your own teaches and mentors and what they taught you!

- Do we want a blog? At the moment this is called "Events and courses" so it covers both courses and anything else. Good to have some content that is updated regularly, but obviously that takes time.

- Add feeback quotes
- June 2017: “I truly enjoyed the whole workshop. Great teachers, really nice real data examples and good notes and background. Everything was very well thought out and explained.”

June 2017: “I was really impressed with everything covered and how it was presented. I am feeling a lot better about using stats now than I was previously. I learned something in all the sessions and it was good having multiple presenters. I think it should be a compulsory course for all new PhDs, particularly in biol/sees/etc.”

June 2017: “The whole course was excellent! Well organised, great notes. The informal style made it easy to ask questions. Good amount of breaks. Approachable, willing-to-help teachers. Will definitely recommend to others."

Feb 2017: “As a complete newbie to R, and having just had a panic attack last week about needing to run CART and Random Forest with little know-how, this was a phenomenal workshop. I thought all three of you were excellent teachers that were engaging and relatable. I feel like I have a much better grasp of the program and its coding language, and am much more confident that I'll be able to adeptly run my analyses and understand the outputs...It was an amazing resource for a beginner like me, and brought me back from the brink of quitting my PhD!”

Feb 2016: “I think this is one of the best workshops I have been to in terms of achieving the set goals. I now have the ability to start chasing stats in R. I think both researchers have a great passion and knowledge for their subject, but also a highly developed skill at being able to explain complex (or things that seem hard) ideas in a logical and understandable manner. Finally very refreshing to hear researchers with such a high degree of emphasis on integrity, repeatably and ethics. Great job will recommend to all my staff.”

June 2015: “Prior to attending the workshop I was terrified of using R. I'd been to a one-day workshop at UQ before but it had moved too fast and used examples I couldn't relate to my project. After spending 3 days with Ant and Dave I am feeling much more confident, happy to at least have a go at what I need to do in R and am not afraid to ask for help from the R community at UQ that I wasn't previously aware of.”

June 2015: “It was terrific, learnt so much, can't wait to apply it all.”

June 2015: “This is the second R workshop that I have attended and to be honest I was a little worried about what to expect. But after attending, I feel like I actually have a chance of being able to work R! Your ability to teach the program is excellent and I really liked the fact that you took the time to explain what things were…"
