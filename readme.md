Webpage under development for Ant, Dave and Chris R resources.

TODO:
- Add some graphics made with R to home page e.g. GAM fits from Copepod data? see plankton.jpg. Need to work on layout for this... 

- Who we are - please edit and add something about your own teaches and mentors and what they taught you!

- Do we want a blog? At the moment this is called "Events and courses" so it covers both courses and anything else. Good to have some content that is updated regularly, but obviously that takes time.
